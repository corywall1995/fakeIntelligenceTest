        Welcome to my intelligence test. During this test you will be presented
        with examples in the form x, y -> z (x and y yields z) and an incomplete
        example. Your job is to figure the puzzle out and input the answer in the
        text box provided. If you get it correct a message will display to let
        you know its correct, if you're incorrect a message will be display telling
        you so. If the questions prove too difficult you may use the hint button. Using a hint will
        only take off half credit should you get the answer correct after using
        the hint. Once you use you hint the skip option will become available to you.
        You may begin the test by clicking
        <a href="test_page_1.html">here</a> or by clicking on the "start test" link
        to the right.
